/*
 * The UniFi Protect realtime updates API is largely undocumented and has been reverse engineered mostly through
 * trial and error, as well as observing the Protect controller in action.
 *
 * Here's how to get started with the UniFi Protect Updates API:
 *
 * 1. Login to the UniFi Protect controller, obtain the bootstrap JSON.
 * 2. Open the websocket to the updates URL (see protect-api.ts).
 *
 * Then you're ready to listen to messages. You can see an example of this in protect-nvr.ts.
 *
 * Those are the basics and gets us up and running. Now, to explain how the updates API works...
 *
 * UniFi OS update data packets are used to provide a realtime stream of updates to Protect. It differs from
 * the system events API in that the system events API appears to be shared across other applications (Network, Access, etc.)
 * while the updates events API appears to only be utilized by Protect and not shared by other applications, although the protocol
 * is shared.
 *
 * So how does it all work? Cameras continuously stream updates to the UniFi Protect controller containing things like camera
 * health, statistics, and - crucially for us - events such as motion and doorbell ring. A complete update packet is composed of four
 * frames:
 *
 * Header Frame (8 bytes)
 * Action Frame
 * Header Frame (8 bytes)
 * Data Frame
 *
 * The header frame is required overhead since websockets provide only a transport medium. It's purpose is to tell us what's
 * coming in the frame that follows.
 *
 * The action frame identifies what the action and category that the update contains:
 *
 * Property      Description
 * --------      -----------
 * action        What action is being taken. Known actions are "add" and "update".
 * id            The identifier for the device we're updating.
 * modelKey      The device model category that we're updating.
 * newUpdateId   A new UUID generated on a per-update basis. This can be safely ignored it seems.
 *
 * The final part of the update packet is the data frame. The data frame can be three different types of data - although in
 * practice, I've only seen JSONs come across. Those types are:
 *
 * Payload Type  Description
 * 1             JSON. For update actions that are not events, this is always a subset of the configuration bootstrap JSON.
 * 2             A UTF8-encoded string
 * 3             Node Buffer
 *
 * Some tips:
 *
 * - "update" actions are always tied to the following modelKeys: camera, event, nvr, and user.
 *
 * - "add" actions are always tied to the "event" modelKey and indicate the beginning of an event item in the Protect events list.
 *   A subsequent "update" action is sent signaling the end of the event capture, and it's confidence score for motion detection.
 *
 * - The above is NOT the same thing as motion detection. If you want to detect motion, you should watch the "update" action for "camera"
 *   modelKeys, and look for a JSON that updates lastMotion. For doorbell rings, lastRing. The Protect events list is useful for the
 *   Protect app, but it's of limited utility to HomeKit, and it's slow - relative to looking for lastMotion that is. If you want true
 *   realtime updates, you want to look at the "update" action.
 *
 * - JSONs are only payload type that seems to be sent, although the protocol is designed to accept all three.
 *
 * - With the exception of update actions with a modelKey of event, JSONs are always a subset of the bootstrap JSON, indexed off
 *   of modelKey. So for a modelKey of camera, the data payload is always a subset of ProtectCameraConfigInterface (see protect-types.ts).
